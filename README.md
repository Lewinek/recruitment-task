# Marketplace App – Recruitment Task

## 📌 Overview
This project is a small Android application built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, created as a solution to the recruitment task.

The app loads ads from a remote JSON endpoint and presents them in a clean UI across three main screens:

- **Ads List** – displays all available ads with photo, price, location and title  
- **Ad Details Screen** – shows full details of a selected ad  
- **Favorites Screen** – allows marking ads as favorite and browsing saved items  

The goal was to implement a lightweight marketplace-style app using modern Android tools and architecture.

## 👍 What I liked
- I liked the complete freedom in designing the layout, which made the UI development more enjoyable  
- It was nice to have around 8 hours of focused work time, even if not everything I planned fit into the final implementation
- I improved the details screen by adding contact buttons to make it look more complete and visually balanced  
- Integrating remote JSON loading and mapping it into clean UI models  
- Structuring the app with a simple but clear **ViewModel-based** state management

## 🚧 What could be better *(not implemented because of limited time)*
- Extracting all hard-coded strings into **strings.xml**  
- Moving repeated numeric/layout values into a separate **constants/resources file**  
- Creating more **reusable UI components** to reduce duplication  
- Implementing a **feature flag** to enable/disable the Favorites feature with one config value  
- Adding proper **placeholder UI** for loading and error image states
