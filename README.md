# recruitment-task
Overview

This project is a small Android app built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, created as a solution to the recruitment task.
The app loads ads from a remote JSON endpoint and presents them in a clean UI across three screens:

Ads list – shows all available ads with photo, price, location and title

Ad details screen – displays full details of a selected ad

Favorites screen – allows marking ads as favorite and browsing saved items

The goal was to implement a lightweight marketplace-style app using modern Android tools and architecture.
